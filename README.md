# 💫 About Me:
### Hello there 👋 

I am a passionate Android developer with a strong foundation in Java programming language. Although I am relatively new to the industry, I have developed several apps and have gained experience with popular libraries like Retrofit and technologies like Firebase.<br><br>As a developer, I am always willing to learn new things and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. I am adaptable and can quickly pick up new skills and techniques to ensure that I deliver high-quality and modern solutions.<br><br>Although I have limited experience, I have a good understanding of design patterns like MVVM and MVC and have developed a few projects using these patterns. I am always eager to learn new patterns and best practices to improve my development skills.<br><br>In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with other developers to learn from their experience. My primary goal as an Android developer is to create efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly applications that make a positive impact on the lives of users.
